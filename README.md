# Radiator

In our office, an old, noisy and power-hungry Windows PC was running just to [display a build monitor](https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-monitor-plugin). Eventually I wrote this build monitor to replace the old PC with a Raspberry Pi *(thanks to Lars for the motivation)*.

I've been running Radiator successfully for over a year now with a number of Jenkins installations. That said, Radiator has only been tested with Jenkins installations I use. 

But one of the great things about open source projects is that anyone can contribute, isn't it? 
So please write bug reports, send pull requests and contribute!
